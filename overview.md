# Overview

**Whole heart reconstruction**: refers to the process of generating a 3D model of the entire heart from a series of 2D medical images, such as CT or MRI scans. This technique is also known as **"cardiac 3D reconstruction"** and can be used to visualize the heart in 3D and analyze its structure, function, and pathology. This approach can be useful for diagnosis, treatment planning, and research in various cardiovascular conditions.

The process of whole heart reconstruction typically involves multiple steps as below. It requires specialized software and expertise in medical image processing and cardiac anatomy:
- image preprocessing
- segmentation
- registration
- 3D modeling
