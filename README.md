# Overview

## Introduction
2D echocardiography (echo) is likely? the most common imaging modality used for measuring left ventricular function. It is noninvasive, low cost, fast turnaround time, and has high temporal resolution. Measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is a common reason for echo, but output of LV boundaries are in discrete 2D planes. 3D LV geometry needs to be reconstructed from those planes to quantify LV wall motion, acceleration, and strain, or to carry out flow simulations.

**Whole heart reconstruction**: refers to the process of generating a 3D model of the entire heart from a series of 2D medical images, such as CT or MRI scans. This technique is also known as **"cardiac 3D reconstruction"** and can be used to visualize the heart in 3D and analyze its structure, function, and pathology. This approach can be useful for diagnosis, treatment planning, and research in various cardiovascular conditions.

The process of whole heart reconstruction typically involves multiple steps as below. It requires specialized software and expertise in medical image processing and cardiac anatomy:
- image preprocessing
- segmentation
- registration
- 3D modeling

## Goal
The primary goal of this repository is to explore various methods that allow 3D reconstruction of the heart from 2D echocardiography images.

## Methods to explore and compare
Pix2Voxx++ from [Stojanvoski D. et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13424)

### Pix2Voxx++ (PiVox)
This method uses two types of synthetic data: 1) segmentation dataset containing binary tissue masks (segmentations) on 2D standard views. Masks are simulated by slicing 3D computational models (allows for 3D ground truths for evaluation) and 2) synthetic US dataset containing synthetic 2D standard US views, generated from tissue masks.

### PiVox/Accurate (PiVox/Fast)

### PiVox/Fast Network
Proposed by Xie et al. as a lighter weight, albeit lower performing, variant of the PiVox/Accurate network (PiVox/Fast) that uses ResNet-18 instead of ResNet-50, decreased de/convolution kernel sizes, and removal of the refiner module.

### E-PiVox from Stojanvoski D. et al.
Adaptation of PiVox networks via addition of 3D convolution at end of encoder module along the input image dimension to reduce decoder to a single branch for any number of input images.
